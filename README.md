# downloadCleanup
Just a quick program to clean up your download folder and delete files after x amount of days (i have this set for 1 year default)

1. to change the age of file you want to delete in your download folder just update this line

# Set the time threshold for 365 days ago
time_threshold = now - (365 * 24 * 60 * 60)


2. be sure you change the path to your actual DL folder as well.
